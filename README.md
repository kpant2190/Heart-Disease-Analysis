# Heart-Disease-Analysis
This project investigates a dataset of heart disease patients to determine patterns and build predictive models for diagnosing heart disease. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building classification models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is publicly available and can be accessed here: [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/data)  
The dataset contains several features related to patients' health, including:
- Age, sex, and other demographic information
- Various medical attributes (cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.)
- Target variable indicating heart disease diagnosis (presence or absence of heart disease)

## Installation
To run this notebook, you'll need Python and Jupyter Notebook installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

Install the dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Structure
- **heart_disease_analysis.ipynb :** Jupyter notebook with all the steps of data analysis, EDA, and model training.
- **README.md :** Project overview and explanations of the steps taken in the notebook.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA examines relationships between features and the target variable to identify patterns, trends, and correlations. Key steps include:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- **Feature Correlation:** Identifying significant features that have a strong relationship with heart disease.
- **Visualization:** Graphical representation of data using histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc., to gain insights into feature distribution and relationships.
